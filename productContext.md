# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Product Context

## Product Vision

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI models to securely access, process, and utilize contextual information from web applications and browsers. Our vision is to create a standardized framework that bridges the gap between AI capabilities and web context, allowing for intelligent, context-aware assistance while preserving security and user privacy.

MCP will revolutionize how AI interacts with web applications by providing:

1. **Contextual Awareness**: AI models that understand what users are seeing and doing
2. **Privacy-Preserving Integration**: Secure context sharing with strong user controls
3. **Cross-Platform Standardization**: Consistent implementation across frameworks and browsers
4. **Developer Empowerment**: Easy-to-use tools for building context-aware AI features
5. **User Control**: Transparent and granular privacy settings for context sharing
