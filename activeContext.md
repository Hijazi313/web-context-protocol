# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in the planning phase of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) project. The main focus is on finalizing the project documentation and preparing for the implementation phase.

## Key Documents

1. **MCP_PRD.md**: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document outlining all aspects of the MCP project.
2. **projectBrief.md**: High-level summary of the project for stakeholder communication.
3. **techContext.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details.
4. **systemPatterns.md**: Design patterns and architectural principles.
5. **progress.md**: Tracking document for project progress.

## Current Tasks

1. Finalizing project documentation
2. Setting up development environment
3. Creating initial project structure
4. Planning first implementation sprint

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Context Acquisition Layer**: This is the foundation of the MCP and will be implemented first.

   - DOM Observer
   - User Interaction Tracker
   - App State Collector

2. **Privacy Filtering Layer**: Critical for ensuring user privacy and security.

   - PII Detection & Redaction
   - Content Masking
   - Permission Enforcer

3. **Chrome Extension Framework**: The initial platform for MCP implementation.
   - Background Service Worker
   - Content Scripts
   - UI Components for Privacy Controls

## Technical Decisions

1. **TypeScript**: We will use TypeScript for all implementation to ensure type safety and better developer experience.
2. **Modular Architecture**: The system will be built with a modular architecture to allow for flexibility and extensibility.
3. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls will be built into the core architecture from the beginning.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Performance considerations will be integrated throughout the implementation.
5. **Cross-Framework Support**: The core functionality will be framework-agnostic with adapters for specific frameworks.

## Open Questions

1. How to handle cross-origin isolation requirements in the Chrome extension?
2. What is the optimal approach for PII detection with minimal performance impact?
3. How to structure the API for maximum compatibility with different AI models?
4. What is the best approach for handling authentication and authorization?
5. How to ensure backward compatibility as the protocol evolves?

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub repository with initial project structure
2. Create development environment setup documentation
3. Implement proof-of-concept for DOM observation with privacy filtering
4. Develop initial Chrome extension skeleton
5. Create first framework adapter (React)
