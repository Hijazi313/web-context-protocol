# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in the planning phase of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) project. The main focus is on finalizing the project documentation and preparing for the implementation phase.

## Key Documents

1. **MCP_PRD.md**: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document outlining all aspects of the MCP project.
2. **projectBrief.md**: High-level summary of the project for stakeholder communication.
3. **techContext.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details.
4. **systemPatterns.md**: Design patterns and architectural principles.
5. **progress.md**: Tracking document for project progress.

## Current Tasks

1. Finalizing project documentation
2. Setting up development environment
3. Creating initial project structure
4. Planning first implementation sprint

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Context Acquisition Layer**: This is the foundation of the MCP and will be implemented first.

   - DOM Observer
   - User Interaction Tracker
   - App State Collector

2. **Privacy Filtering Layer**: Critical for ensuring user privacy and security.

   - PII Detection & Redaction
   - Content Masking
   - Permission Enforcer

3. **Chrome Extension Framework**: The initial platform for MCP implementation.
   - Background Service Worker
   - Content Scripts
   - UI Components for Privacy Controls

## Technical Decisions

1. **TypeScript**: We will use TypeScript for all implementation to ensure type safety and better developer experience.
2. **Modular Architecture**: The system will be built with a modular architecture to allow for flexibility and extensibility.
3. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls will be built into the core architecture from the beginning.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Performance considerations will be integrated throughout the implementation.
5. **Cross-Framework Support**: The core functionality will be framework-agnostic with adapters for specific frameworks.

## Open Questions

1. How to handle cross-origin isolation requirements in the Chrome extension?
2. What is the optimal approach for PII detection with minimal performance impact?
3. How to structure the API for maximum compatibility with different AI models?
4. What is the best approach for handling authentication and authorization?
5. How to ensure backward compatibility as the protocol evolves?

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub repository with initial project structure
2. Create development environment setup documentation
3. Implement proof-of-concept for DOM observation with privacy filtering
4. Develop initial Chrome extension skeleton
5. Create first framework adapter (React)

## Current Project: Website Audit Tool

We've implemented a comprehensive website auditing tool that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze websites and generate detailed reports. This tool demonstrates how MCP can be used to capture and analyze website context for practical applications.

### Key Features

- Accessibility analysis against WCAG guidelines
- Performance metrics for loading times and resource usage
- SEO analysis for meta tags and content structure
- Security assessment for potential vulnerabilities
- Privacy compliance checking for tracking scripts and cookies
- Responsive design testing across different screen sizes
- Content quality analysis for readability and structure

### Implementation Status

- Basic application structure is complete
- UI components for all pages are implemented
- Context acquisition using MCP is working
- Analyzer framework with accessibility analyzer is implemented
- Report generation and visualization is functional
- Settings management for configuring preferences is in place

### Current Focus

- Implementing additional analyzers for other audit categories
- Enhancing the report visualization with more interactive charts
- Adding authentication for saving and comparing reports
- Supporting batch processing for multiple pages or sites

### Known Issues

- Currently using mock data since we don't have a real MCP implementation
- Some UI components need refinement for better user experience
- Need to implement error handling for failed audits
- Performance optimization for large websites is needed
