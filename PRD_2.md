# Product Requirements Document: Web Development MCP for Chrome

## Executive Summary

The Web Development Model Context Protocol (WebDev MCP) is an advanced AI-powered assistant integrated with Chrome that streamlines front-end development workflows. It combines real-time browser context with intelligent code generation, testing, and debugging capabilities to significantly reduce development time and improve code quality.

## 1. Product Vision

To create an intelligent development companion that understands both the browser environment and development context, providing automated solutions that eliminate repetitive tasks and accelerate the web development process.

## 2. Target Users

- Front-end developers
- UI/UX designers who code
- Full-stack developers working on client-side features
- Web development agencies and teams
- Independent web developers and freelancers

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Browser Context Awareness

- **DOM Analysis**: Real-time access to rendered DOM structure
- **Style Inspection**: Ability to inspect and understand CSS properties and computed styles
- **Responsive Design Validation**: Detection of layout issues across viewport sizes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of page load metrics and render performance

### 3.2 Intelligent Code Generation

- **Component Creation**: Generate React, Vue, or Angular components based on visual references
- **CSS Generation**: Create optimized CSS/SCSS based on design specifications
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Generate event handlers and interactive behaviors
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure generated code meets WCAG standards

### 3.3 Automated Testing and Validation

- **Unit Test Generation**: Automatically create Jest, Mocha, or other framework tests
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare rendered output against expected designs
- **Cross-browser Compatibility Checks**: Validate code works across major browsers
- **Performance Testing**: Analyze and optimize for load times and rendering efficiency

### 3.4 Real-time Debugging

- **Error Detection**: Identify JavaScript, CSS, and HTML errors in real-time
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace errors to their source and suggest fixes
- **Console Log Enhancement**: Smart filtering and organization of console outputs
- **Network Request Optimization**: Identify and fix inefficient API calls and resource loading

### 3.5 Development Workflow Integration

- **Git Integration**: Commit suggestions, branch management recommendations
- **Package Management**: NPM/Yarn dependency suggestions and updates
- **Build Process Optimization**: Webpack/Vite configuration improvements
- **Deployment Preparation**: Pre-deployment checklists and validations
