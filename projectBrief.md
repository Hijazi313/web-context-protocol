# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a comprehensive framework enabling AI models to securely access, process, and utilize contextual information from web applications and browsers. This protocol bridges the gap between AI capabilities and web context, allowing for intelligent, context-aware assistance while preserving security and user privacy.

## Key Objectives

1. Create a universal context protocol for web applications and browsers
2. Establish clear user consent and control mechanisms for context sharing
3. Enable cross-framework and cross-platform compatibility
4. Establish clear privacy controls and security boundaries
5. Reduce development effort for context-aware AI features
6. Optimize performance for real-time context sharing

## Core Components

1. **Context Acquisition System**: Securely captures browser and application context
2. **Privacy Control Center**: User interface for managing context sharing permissions
3. **Context Processing Pipeline**: Transforms raw context into AI-suitable data
4. **Model Integration API**: Standardized interface for AI models to utilize context
5. **Web Component Library**: Ready-to-use components for context-aware features
6. **Action Framework**: Capabilities for AI models to interact with web content
7. **Developer Tools & SDK**: Tools to help developers build MCP-compatible applications

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Web Components
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- **Browser Integration**: Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3)
- **APIs**: REST, WebSocket, GraphQL
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0, TLS 1.3+, E2E encryption
- **Development Tools**: Cursor IDE integration, automated testing

## Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation** (Month 1-2): Core context acquisition, basic privacy filtering
2. **Core Features** (Month 3-4): Context processing, model integration, privacy controls
3. **Advanced Features** (Month 5-6): Action framework, cross-app bridge, code generation

## Success Metrics

- Developer adoption in 100+ web applications within 6 months
- 90% of users report confidence in privacy controls
- 70% reduction in time to implement context-aware features
- Context acquisition with <20ms overhead per page
- 40% increase in development speed for UI components

## Current Status

Project is in planning phase. PRD has been created and approved. Next steps include setting up the development environment and beginning implementation of the foundation phase.
