      <h3>Understanding the Model Context Protocol</h3>
      <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework for capturing, processing, and providing web context to AI models. It enables AI assistants to understand web page structure, user interactions, and application state while respecting privacy constraints.</p>
      
      <p>At its core, MCP consists of several key components:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Context Acquisition</strong>: Capturing DOM structure, user interactions, and application state from web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Filtering</strong>: Ensuring sensitive information is properly handled with configurable privacy levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Context Processing</strong>: Transforming raw context into structured, relevant information for AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Integration</strong>: Enabling AI models to consume context and perform actions based on it.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>MCP is designed with privacy as a core principle, offering three privacy levels:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strict</strong>: Minimal data collection with aggressive PII filtering.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced</strong>: Moderate data collection with PII redaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissive</strong>: Comprehensive data collection with basic PII protection.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The protocol is implemented as a set of packages that can be used together or individually:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>@mcp/core</strong>: Core interfaces, types, and utilities.</li>
        <li><strong>@mcp/browser</strong>: Browser-specific context provider implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>@mcp/privacy</strong>: Privacy filtering and PII detection.</li>
        <li><strong>@mcp/processing</strong>: Context processing and transformation.</li>
        <li><strong>@mcp/model</strong>: Model integration and API.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By using MCP, developers can easily integrate AI capabilities into their web applications while ensuring user privacy and providing rich context to AI models.</p>

      <h3>The Future of AI in Web Applications</h3>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we interact with web applications. From personalized recommendations to intelligent assistants, AI is becoming an integral part of the web experience.</p>
      
      <p>Several key trends are shaping the future of AI in web applications:</p>
      
      <h4>1. Context-Aware AI Assistants</h4>
      <p>The next generation of AI assistants will be deeply integrated into web applications, understanding not just the content but also the structure, state, and user interactions. This contextual awareness will enable more helpful and relevant assistance.</p>
      
      <h4>2. Privacy-First AI</h4>
      <p>As privacy concerns grow, AI systems are being designed with privacy as a core principle rather than an afterthought. This includes techniques like federated learning, differential privacy, and on-device processing to minimize data exposure.</p>
      
      <h4>3. Multimodal Understanding</h4>
      <p>Future AI systems will understand multiple modes of information - text, images, layout, interactions - to provide a more comprehensive understanding of web content and user intent.</p>
      
      <h4>4. Standardized Protocols</h4>
      <p>Standardized protocols for AI integration, like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), will make it easier for developers to add AI capabilities to their applications without reinventing the wheel.</p>
      
      <h4>5. Edge AI</h4>
      <p>More AI processing will happen on the client side, reducing latency and enhancing privacy by keeping sensitive data on the user's device.</p>
      
      <p>These trends point to a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into web applications, providing intelligent assistance while respecting user privacy and enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

      <h3>Implementing Privacy-Respecting AI Systems</h3>
      <p>As AI systems become more integrated into our digital lives, ensuring they respect user privacy is increasingly important. Here are key strategies for implementing privacy-respecting AI systems:</p>
      
      <h4>Data Minimization</h4>
      <p>Collect only the data necessary for the AI system to function effectively. This reduces the risk of privacy breaches and builds user trust. Techniques include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selective context capture</li>
        <li>Configurable privacy levels</li>
        <li>Purpose-specific data collection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>PII Detection and Redaction</h4>
      <p>Implement robust systems for detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before it reaches AI models:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pattern matching for common PII types (emails, phone numbers, etc.)</li>
        <li>Named entity recognition for identifying names and locations</li>
        <li>Context-aware PII detection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Transparency and Control</h4>
      <p>Provide users with transparency about what data is being collected and how it's used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear privacy policies</li>
        <li>User-configurable privacy settings</li>
        <li>Visual indicators when context is being captured</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Privacy-Enhancing Technologies</h4>
      <p>Leverage advanced technologies to enhance privacy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Federated learning: Train models across devices without centralizing data</li>
        <li>Differential privacy: Add noise to data to protect individual privacy</li>
        <li>Homomorphic encryption: Perform computations on encrypted data</li>
        <li>Secure enclaves: Process sensitive data in isolated environments</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Compliance with Regulations</h4>
      <p>Design systems to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and others:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)</li>
        <li>Lawful basis for processing</li>
        <li>Data protection impact assessments</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By implementing these strategies, developers can create AI systems that provide valuable functionality while respecting user privacy and building trust.</p>
