# Website Audit Tool

This example demonstrates how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a comprehensive website auditing tool that can analyze websites and generate detailed reports.

## Features

- **Accessibility Analysis**: Check for WCAG compliance issues
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure loading times, resource usage, and rendering performance
- **SEO Analysis**: Evaluate meta tags, headings, content structure, and more
- **Security Assessment**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
- **Privacy Compliance**: Check for tracking scripts, cookie usage, and privacy policy
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Evaluate website behavior across different screen sizes
- **Content Quality Analysis**: Assess readability, keyword usage, and content structure

## How It Works

1. The MCP browser extension captures comprehensive context from the target website
2. The context is processed through specialized analyzers for each audit category
3. Results are compiled into a detailed report with actionable recommendations
4. Privacy controls ensure sensitive information is not included in the audit

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/website-audit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the example
npm run build

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:3000)
2. Enter the URL of the website you want to audit
3. Configure audit settings (categories, depth, etc.)
4. Click "Start Audit" to begin the analysis
5. View the generated report with findings and recommendations

## Implementation Details

This example uses:

- MCP Core for context acquisition
- MCP Browser for DOM and interaction tracking
- MCP Privacy for sensitive information filtering
- MCP Processing for context analysis
- Custom analyzers for each audit category
- React for the user interface

## Privacy Considerations

The audit tool respects user privacy by:

- Applying appropriate privacy filters to all captured context
- Not storing any PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Providing clear controls for what data is included in the audit
- Allowing users to exclude sensitive sections of websites

## Extending the Tool

You can extend this audit tool by:

1. Adding new analyzers for additional audit categories
2. Customizing the scoring algorithms
3. Creating industry-specific audit profiles
4. Integrating with other tools and services
