# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Project Progress

## Current Status: Planning Phase

The MCP project is currently in the planning phase. We have completed the PRD and technical architecture documentation. The next steps involve setting up the development environment and beginning implementation of the foundation phase.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Define project scope and objectives
- [x] Create comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- [x] Design high-level technical architecture
- [x] Define core components and their interactions
- [x] Document API interfaces and data models
- [x] Create project brief for stakeholder communication

## In Progress

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create project repository structure
- [ ] Define coding standards and guidelines
- [ ] Set up automated testing infrastructure
- [ ] Create initial project documentation

## Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)

- [ ] Implement core DOM observer
- [ ] Develop basic user interaction tracker
- [ ] Create app state collector with framework adapters
- [ ] Implement basic privacy filtering system
- [ ] Develop foundation API layer
- [ ] Set up Chrome extension skeleton with Manifest V3
- [ ] Create basic UI for privacy controls
- [ ] Implement storage and persistence layer

### Phase 2: Core Features (Month 3-4)

- [ ] Complete context processing pipeline
- [ ] Develop Model Integration API
- [ ] Create reference implementations for major frameworks
- [ ] Build comprehensive Privacy Control Center UI
- [ ] Implement Web Component Library
- [ ] Conduct initial security audit
- [ ] Expand automated testing coverage

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 5-6)

- [ ] Implement Action Framework
- [ ] Develop Cross-Application Bridge
- [ ] Create Server-Side Context Sources
- [ ] Implement Intelligent Code Generation
- [ ] Develop Real-time Debugging features
- [ ] Complete developer toolkit
- [ ] Perform performance optimization
- [ ] Finalize documentation and examples
- [ ] Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## Key Milestones

- [ ] **M2**: Privacy control system complete (Mid Month 2)
- [ ] **M3**: First framework integration (React) complete (End of Month 2)
- [ ] **M4**: Model Integration API stable and documented (Mid Month 3)
- [ ] **M5**: All major framework integrations complete (End of Month 4)
- [ ] **M6**: Advanced features implemented (Mid Month 6)
- [ ] **M7**: Production-ready release (End of Month 6)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                        | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser API limitations     | High   | Medium     | Research alternatives, create polyfills             |
| Performance overhead        | High   | Medium     | Implement aggressive optimization, lazy loading     |
| Privacy concerns            | High   | High       | Thorough security review, default to strict privacy |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Medium | High       | Focus on Chrome first, then expand                  |
| Developer adoption barriers | Medium | Medium     | Create comprehensive documentation and examples     |

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment and repository
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement core DOM observer prototype
4. Develop basic privacy filtering system
5. Create Chrome extension skeleton
