- [ ] **M4**: Model Integration API stable and documented (Mid Month 3)
- [ ] **M5**: All major framework integrations complete (End of Month 4)
- [ ] **M6**: Advanced features implemented (Mid Month 6)
- [ ] **M7**: Production-ready release (End of Month 6)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                        | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser API limitations     | High   | Medium     | Research alternatives, create polyfills             |
| Performance overhead        | High   | Medium     | Implement aggressive optimization, lazy loading     |
| Privacy concerns            | High   | High       | Thorough security review, default to strict privacy |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Medium | High       | Focus on Chrome first, then expand                  |
| Developer adoption barriers | Medium | Medium     | Create comprehensive documentation and examples     |

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment and repository
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement core DOM observer prototype
4. Develop basic privacy filtering system
5. Create Chrome extension skeleton

## 2023-06-15: Website Audit Tool Implementation

### Completed

- Created a new example application: Website Audit Tool
- Implemented the basic structure of the application using React and TypeScript
- Created UI components for all pages (Home, Audit, Report, Settings)
- Implemented context acquisition using MCP
- Created analyzer framework with accessibility analyzer implementation
- Implemented report generation and visualization using Chart.js
- Added settings management for configuring audit preferences
- Created comprehensive documentation including README and implementation analysis

### Technical Highlights

- Used MCP's context acquisition capabilities to capture website DOM structure
- Implemented a modular analyzer system that can be easily extended
- Created a scoring algorithm for evaluating website quality
- Used React for building a responsive and accessible UI
- Implemented data visualization using Chart.js
- Used TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

### Challenges

- Working with mock data since we don't have a real MCP implementation
- Designing a flexible analyzer system that can handle different types of audits
- Creating meaningful visualizations for complex audit data
- Balancing comprehensive analysis with performance considerations

### Next Steps

- Implement remaining analyzers (performance, SEO, security, etc.)
- Add authentication for saving and comparing reports
- Enhance visualizations with more interactive charts
- Support batch processing for multiple pages
- Add trend analysis for comparing reports over time
