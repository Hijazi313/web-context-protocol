# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Web Development

## Document Information

- **Document Status**: Draft
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: March 14, 2025
- **Product Owner**: [Your Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Web Development creates a standardized framework enabling AI models to access, process, and utilize contextual information from any web application. This protocol bridges the gap between AI capabilities and web context, allowing for intelligent, context-aware assistance while preserving security and user privacy. The MCP is designed to work across frameworks, platforms, and development environments.

## 2. Problem Statement

Web developers and users face significant challenges when integrating AI capabilities into applications:

- Context fragmentation across different applications and platforms
- Repetitive context-sharing between web applications and AI services
- Inconsistent approaches to privacy and security in context sharing
- Framework-specific implementation barriers
- Performance overhead of AI integration
- Development complexity when building context-aware features

### 2.1 Current Limitations

- Siloed context between applications and AI services
- Manual implementation of context collection for each project
- Inconsistent privacy practices across implementations
- Framework-dependent solutions that aren't portable
- High technical barriers for implementing context-aware AI features
- Limited standardization in the AI-web integration space
