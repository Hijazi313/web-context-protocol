5. **Build System**:
   - Added Rollup configuration for all packages

## Current Focus

1. **Testing**: Adding comprehensive tests for all packages
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improving performance of context acquisition and processing
3. **Security Audit**: Conducting a security audit of privacy mechanisms
4. **Documentation**: Enhancing documentation with more examples and use cases

## Known Issues

1. **Interface Naming Conflicts**: Resolved by renaming interfaces
2. **Property Mismatches**: Resolved by updating interface implementations
3. **Error Handling**: Improved but needs more comprehensive approach
4. **Performance with Large DOM Trees**: Needs optimization
5. **Test Coverage**: Needs improvement

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Add comprehensive tests for core and browser packages
   - Optimize DOM tree traversal performance
   - Create additional documentation for example applications

2. **Medium Term (1-2 months)**:

   - Add tests for privacy and processing packages
   - Create more complex example applications
   - Implement browser extension support
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Long Term (3+ months)**:
   - Implement server-side rendering support
   - Create framework-specific integrations
   - Add visualization tools
   - Implement context compression

## Current Questions and Decisions

1. **Example Applications**:

   - Should we add a fourth example focusing on a different use case?
   - How can we enhance the existing examples with more advanced features?
   - What real-world integrations should we prioritize?

2. **Privacy Strategy Implementation**:

   - Should we use a strategy pattern for privacy levels?
   - How should we handle custom privacy rules?
   - How can we improve transparency about what data is being shared?

3. **Performance Optimization**:

   - What are the bottlenecks in context acquisition?
   - How can we reduce the size of the context?
   - Should we implement context caching?

4. **API Design**:
   - Is the current API intuitive for developers?
   - Are there any missing features in the API?
   - How can we simplify the integration process?
