# Model Context Protocol - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework for capturing, processing, and providing web context to AI models. It enables AI assistants to understand web page structure, user interactions, and application state while respecting privacy constraints.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the MCP is to bridge the gap between web applications and AI models by providing a structured, privacy-respecting way to capture and process web context. This enables AI assistants to:

1. Understand the structure and content of web pages
2. Track user interactions and navigation
3. Access application state and framework information
4. Perform actions based on the context
5. Respect user privacy and data protection requirements

## Goals

1. **Standardization**: Create a standard protocol for context acquisition and processing that can be adopted across different AI models and web applications.
2. **Privacy**: Ensure user privacy through configurable privacy levels and PII detection/redaction.
3. **Performance**: Minimize the performance impact on web applications through optimized context capture and processing.
4. **Extensibility**: Enable developers to extend and customize the protocol for their specific needs.
5. **Framework Agnostic**: Support all major JavaScript frameworks and vanilla JavaScript applications.
6. **Developer Experience**: Provide a simple, intuitive API for developers to integrate the protocol into their applications.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Context acquisition from web browsers
- Privacy filtering and PII detection/redaction
- Context processing and transformation
- Model integration and API
- Event system for real-time updates
- Documentation and examples
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Performance optimization
- TypeScript support

### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)

- Server-side rendering support
- Mobile app context acquisition (React Native, Flutter)
- Desktop app context acquisition (Electron, Tauri)
- AI model implementation
- Context visualization tools
- Analytics and telemetry
- Internationalization
- Accessibility analysis

## Target Audience

1. **AI Model Developers**: Teams building AI assistants that need to understand web context.
2. **Web Application Developers**: Developers integrating AI assistants into their web applications.
3. **Privacy Engineers**: Professionals ensuring that user data is handled responsibly.
4. **Framework Maintainers**: Teams maintaining JavaScript frameworks who want to provide AI integration.

## Success Criteria

1. **Adoption**: The protocol is adopted by multiple AI model providers and web application developers.
2. **Performance**: The protocol has minimal impact on web application performance (< 5% overhead).
3. **Privacy**: The protocol successfully protects user privacy through configurable privacy levels.
4. **Extensibility**: Developers can easily extend and customize the protocol for their specific needs.
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples are available for developers.
6. **Compatibility**: The protocol works with all major browsers and JavaScript frameworks.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                    | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance overhead    | High   | Medium     | Optimize context capture, use throttling and selective capture       |
| Privacy concerns        | High   | Medium     | Implement configurable privacy levels, PII detection/redaction       |
| Browser compatibility   | Medium | Low        | Use polyfills, feature detection, and graceful degradation           |
| Framework compatibility | Medium | Low        | Design to be framework agnostic, provide framework-specific adapters |
| Adoption challenges     | High   | Medium     | Create comprehensive documentation, examples, and easy integration   |

## Resources

- **Development Team**: 3-5 developers with expertise in TypeScript, browser APIs, and AI integration
- **Testing**: Automated testing infrastructure, browser testing environments
- **Documentation**: Technical writers, documentation platform
- **Community**: Open source community for feedback and contributions

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol aims to standardize the way web context is captured, processed, and provided to AI models, enabling more powerful and privacy-respecting AI assistants. By focusing on standardization, privacy, performance, and extensibility, the MCP will provide a solid foundation for the next generation of AI-enhanced web applications.
