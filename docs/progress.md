## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all packages
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Conduct security audit of privacy mechanisms

## Planned Tasks

- [ ] Add browser extension support
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering support
- [ ] Add React/Vue/Angular specific integrations
- [ ] Create visualization tools for context
- [ ] Add telemetry and analytics
- [ ] Implement context compression
- [ ] Add internationalization support
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues

- Interface naming conflicts between events.ts and context.ts (resolved by renaming)
- Property mismatches between core interfaces and browser implementations (resolved)
- Need for more comprehensive error handling
- Performance concerns with large DOM trees
- Need for more extensive testing

## Future Considerations

- Support for mobile web applications
- Integration with popular AI models
- Support for non-browser environments (Node.js, React Native)
- Enhanced privacy features (differential privacy, federated learning)
- Context persistence and serialization
- Real-time collaboration support
- Comprehensive Testing: Adding tests for all packages and example applications.
- Performance Optimization: Improving the performance of context acquisition and processing.
- Security Audit: Conducting a thorough security audit of privacy mechanisms.
- Framework Integrations: Creating specific integrations for popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
- Real AI Service Integration: Replacing the mock services with actual AI service integrations.
