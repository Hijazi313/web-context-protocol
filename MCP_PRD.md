# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Web Development

## Document Information

- **Document Status**: Draft
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: March 14, 2025
- **Product Owner**: [Your Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a comprehensive framework that enables AI models to securely access, process, and utilize contextual information from web applications and browsers. This protocol bridges the gap between powerful AI capabilities and the rich contextual information available in web environments, allowing for intelligent, context-aware assistance while preserving security and user privacy.

MCP creates a standardized approach for AI models to understand, interact with, and utilize contextual information across all web platforms. It combines real-time browser context with intelligent processing capabilities to significantly enhance AI assistance for developers and end-users alike, while maintaining strong privacy safeguards and user control.

## 2. Problem Statement

Web developers and users face significant challenges when integrating AI capabilities into applications:

- AI assistants operate without awareness of the user's current browser or application context
- Manual context-sharing is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates friction in workflows
- No standardized protocol exists for secure browser/application-to-AI communication
- Context fragmentation across different applications and platforms
- Inconsistent approaches to privacy and security in context sharing
- Framework-specific implementation barriers
- High technical barriers for implementing context-aware AI features
- Performance overhead of AI integration

### 2.1 Current Limitations

- Siloed context between applications and AI services
- Manual implementation of context collection for each project
- Browser extensions that enable AI context access use inconsistent approaches with varying security models
- Inconsistent privacy practices across implementations
- Framework-dependent solutions that aren't portable
- Users lack granular control over what context information is shared
- Limited standardization in the AI-web integration space
